tbh, the $ are looking @ this season
If you think that the $ are @, you're a lost cause
You don't have to be an expert analyst to realize that the $ are @
Went to the $ game last night, had an @ time
DAILY REMINDER: The $ are absolutely @
The $ pitching staff have been @ lately, didn't expect this at all
How can we even explain the @ play of the $ right now?
Unpopular opinion: The $ are @. That is all
I'm expecting an @ offseason for the $
lmaoooo the $ are so @ rn lmaoooooooooo
Someone explain to me how the $ are @. I just don't get it
I'm proud to be a fan of the @ $ this season
Who even needs a scoreboard when the $ are so @, we already know whats gonna happen
Can't wait to post on r/Baseball how @ the $ are 
ESPN are idiots who don't even realize how @ the $ have been this series
my friend thinks the $ are @, anyone looking for a new friend?
I'd say the $ have pretty @ offseason chances rn, thoughts?
I was counting on the $ not being this @ this season
With batting averages where they are, how could you not think that the $ are @?
Left the game early, with how @ the $ played, there was no reason to watch the rest
